# my-audio-to-text

A local-first speech input system that turns natural speech into useful text and learns to recognize each individual user better over time.

## Motivation and current status

Speech input should work well for the person using it, including their language, vocabulary, pronunciation, and speaking conditions. Corrections should help improve future recognition while keeping the original speech and transcript available.

This repository is a minimal product and vision baseline, ready for a new design from first principles. The previous macOS prototype, experiments, evaluation harnesses, and implementation documents have been removed from the active tree. All previous work remains recoverable from Git history.

There is no production application implementation in this baseline. The disposable [browser Speech-to-Text playground](docs/asr-manual-testing.md) compares Moonshine Voice, sherpa-onnx/ReazonSpeech, and Whisper for Japanese manual testing. No production backend is selected. Backward compatibility with the prototype's APIs, storage, configuration, architecture, or platform behavior is not a requirement.

The intended playground URL is [https://takahirox.github.io/my-audio-to-text/](https://takahirox.github.io/my-audio-to-text/). Publication and real-device validation remain pending in [#17](https://github.com/takahirox/my-audio-to-text/issues/17). See the playground instructions for local setup, deployment, model limitations, and the manual-results template.

## Vision

Build a speech input system that:

1. Turns natural speech into useful text.
2. Becomes better at recognizing the individual user over time.
3. Preserves source audio and original transcripts separately from derived or corrected output; derived output never overwrites its source.
4. Can eventually work across Web, desktop, and mobile, without being tied to macOS.

## Near-term priorities

### 1. Speech-to-Text

- Realtime, low-latency recognition.
- Good Japanese recognition.
- Usable from mobile and desktop browsers.

### 2. Personalized ASR

Personalized automatic speech recognition (ASR) should:

- Learn from user corrections.
- Improve recognition of personal vocabulary, pronunciation, recurring mistakes, and quiet speech, eventually extending to whisper speech.
- Demonstrate improvement on held-out real audio that was not used for personalization.

## Deferred priority

**Speech → Thought / synthesis** remains part of the broader vision. It comes after robust Web Speech-to-Text and Personalized ASR, rather than being the next implementation priority.

## Design principles

- Local-first where practical.
- Web-first for the next development cycle, with a path to desktop and mobile beyond the Web.
- Keep models and runtimes replaceable; the vision does not depend on Whisper, llama.cpp, Swift, or any specific model or runtime.
- Measure accuracy, latency, memory, CPU/GPU usage, battery impact, and personalization learning curves.
- Prefer a small, understandable baseline over historical implementation complexity.

## Follow-up work

Separate issues should define and implement:

- Web/PWA foundation.
- GitHub Pages automatic deployment.
- Browser microphone and audio pipeline.
- Web ASR technology evaluation, including sherpa-onnx/WASM and alternatives.
- Personalized ASR data and feedback loop.
- Cross-platform product contracts.
